# tmdb-box-office
In this personal project,  I'm working with data from TMDB Box Office Prediction Challenge on Kaggle. Data points provided include cast, crew, budget, genres, runtime, posters, languages, popularity, release dates, production companies, and production countries. The data can be found from this Kaggle link:

The main focus of the project is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering, which will eventually lead to building statistical model that helps predict movie revenue.

To make it easy to follow, the notebook is divided into 5 main steps:
- Step 1: Describe data
- Step 2: Visualize & Wrangle data
- Step 3: Handle missing data
- Step 4: Create dummy variables
- Step 5: Build model (cont'd)

With step 1, 2 and 3 broken down into numerical vs categorical features
