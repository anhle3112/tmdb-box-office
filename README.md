In this personal project,  I'm working with data from TMDB Box Office Prediction Challenge on Kaggle. Data points provided include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries. The data can be found from this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tmdb-box-office-prediction/

The main focus of the project is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering, which will eventually lead to building statistical model that helps predict movie revenue.
